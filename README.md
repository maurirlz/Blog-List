# Part 4 of the FSO course @ Open University, Helsinki, https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4

The main focus of this part was Backend testing with TDD, using the libraries supertest and Jest, where I tackled several exercises about Testing in general, which was my weak-point in programming before this part, then, the part was mostly User administration, where I was tasked with adding password and Login capabilities to the API, this was of course done with bcrpyt, and the Authorization was done with JWT. I also learned a lot of how web pages behave in the background.

Things I learned in this part:
- Creating my own Node.js and express API with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Modeling schemas for a mongo atlas DB with Mongoose.
- Querying data from said database with Mongoose, Populate, deleteMany, etc.
- Introduction to Backend testing with Integration tests.
- Create my own tests on the backend using supertest and running them with Jest.
- Basic usage of the function-based library Lodash.
- Environment variables and protecting sensible data
- Test refactoring and usage of different developer environments (test, dev, prod)
- ASYNC/AWAIT syntax
- Middleware usage and designing my own middleware.
